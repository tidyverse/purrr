The `purrr_error_indexed` class is thrown by [map()], [map2()], [pmap()], and friends.
It wraps errors thrown during the processing on individual elements with information about the location of the error.

# Structure

`purrr_error_indexed` has three important fields:

-   `location`: the location of the error as a single integer.
-   `name`: the name of the location as a string. If the element was not named, `name` will be `NULL`
-   `parent`: the original error thrown by `.f`.

Let's see this in action by capturing the generated condition from a very simple example:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  rlang::abort("This is an error")
} 

cnd <- rlang::catch_cnd(map(c(1, 4, 2), f))
class(cnd)

cnd$location

cnd$name

cnd$parent
```

If the input vector is named, `name` will be non-`NULL`:

```{r}
cnd <- rlang::catch_cnd(map(c(a = 1, b = 4, c = 2), f))
cnd$name
```

# Handling errors

(This section assumes that you're familiar with the basics of error handling in R, as described in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/conditions.html).)

This error chaining is really useful when doing interactive data analysis, but it adds some extra complexity when handling errors with `tryCatch()` or `withCallingHandlers()`.
Let's see what happens by adding a custom class to the error thrown by `f()`:

```{r}
#| error: true 
f <- function(x) {
  rlang::abort("This is an error", class = "my_error")
} 
map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f)
```

This doesn't change the visual display, but you might be surprised if you try to catch this error with `tryCatch()` or `withCallingHandlers()`:

```{r}
#| error: true
tryCatch(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  my_error = function(err) {
    # use NULL value if error
    NULL
  }
)

withCallingHandlers(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  my_error = function(err) {
    # throw a more informative error
    abort("Wrapped error", parent = err)
  }
)
```

That's because, as described above, the error that `map()` throws will always have class `purrr_error_indexed`:

```{r}
tryCatch(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  purrr_error_indexed = function(err) {
    print("Hello! I am now called :)")
  }
)
```

In order to handle the error thrown by `f()`, you'll need to use `rlang::cnd_inherits()` on the parent error:

```{r}
#| error: true
tryCatch(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  purrr_error_indexed = function(err) {
    if (rlang::cnd_inherits(err, "my_error")) {
      NULL
    } else {
      rlang::cnd_signal(err)
    }
  }
)

withCallingHandlers(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  purrr_error_indexed = function(err) {
    if (rlang::cnd_inherits(err, "my_error")) {
      abort("Wrapped error", parent = err)
    }
  }
)
```

(The `tryCatch()` approach is suboptimal because we're no longer just handling errors, but also rethrowing them.
The rethrown errors won't work correctly with (e.g.) `recover()` and `traceback()`, but we don't currently have a better approach.
In the future we expect to [enhance `try_fetch()`](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/issues/1534) to make this easier to do 100% correctly).

Finally, if you just want to get rid of purrr's wrapper error, you can resignal the parent error:

```{r}
#| error: true
withCallingHandlers(
  map(c(1, 4, 2, 5, 3), f),
  purrr_error_indexed = function(err) {
    rlang::cnd_signal(err$parent)
  }
)
```

Because we are resignalling an error, it's important to use `withCallingHandlers()` and not `tryCatch()` in order to preserve the full backtrace context.
That way `recover()`, `traceback()`, and related tools will continue to work correctly.
