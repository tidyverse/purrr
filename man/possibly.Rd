\title{Wrap a function to return a value instead of an error}
\usage{
possibly(.f, otherwise, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A function, formula, or vector (not necessarily atomic).

If a \strong{function}, it is used as is.

If a \strong{formula}, e.g. \code{~ .x + 2}, it is converted to a function. There
are three ways to refer to the arguments:
\itemize{
\item For a single argument function, use \code{.}
\item For a two argument function, use \code{.x} and \code{.y}
\item For more arguments, use \code{..1}, \code{..2}, \code{..3} etc
}

This syntax allows you to create very compact anonymous
functions. Note that formula functions conceptually take dots
(that's why you can use \code{..1} etc). They silently ignore
additional arguments that are not used in the formula expression.

If \strong{character vector}, \strong{numeric vector}, or \strong{list}, it is
converted to an extractor function. Character vectors index by
name and numeric vectors index by position; use a list to index
by position and name at different levels. If a component is not
present, the value of \code{.default} will be returned.}

\item{otherwise}{Default value to use when an error occurs.}

\item{quiet}{Hide errors (\code{TRUE}, the default), or display them
as they occur?}
}
\value{
A function that takes the same arguments as \code{.f}, but returns
a different value, as described above.
}
\description{
Create a modified version of \code{.f} that return a default value (\code{otherwise})
whenever an error occurs.
}
\section{Adverbs}{
This function is called an adverb because it modifies the effect of a
function (a verb). If you'd like to include a function created an adverb
in a package, be sure to read \link{faq-adverbs-export}.

\examples{
# To replace errors with a default value, use possibly().
