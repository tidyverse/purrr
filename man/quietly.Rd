\title{Wrap a function to capture side-effects}
\usage{
quietly(.f)
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A function, formula, or vector (not necessarily atomic).

If a \strong{function}, it is used as is.

If a \strong{formula}, e.g. \code{~ .x + 2}, it is converted to a function. There
are three ways to refer to the arguments:
\itemize{
\item For a single argument function, use \code{.}
\item For a two argument function, use \code{.x} and \code{.y}
\item For more arguments, use \code{..1}, \code{..2}, \code{..3} etc
}

This syntax allows you to create very compact anonymous
functions. Note that formula functions conceptually take dots
(that's why you can use \code{..1} etc). They silently ignore
additional arguments that are not used in the formula expression.

If \strong{character vector}, \strong{numeric vector}, or \strong{list}, it is
converted to an extractor function. Character vectors index by
name and numeric vectors index by position; use a list to index
by position and name at different levels. If a component is not
present, the value of \code{.default} will be returned.}
}
\value{
A function that takes the same arguments as \code{.f}, but returns
a different value, as described above.
}
\description{
Create a modified version of \code{.f} that captures side-effects along with
the return value of the function and returns a list containing
the \code{result}, \code{output}, \code{messages} and \code{warnings}.
}
\section{Adverbs}{
This function is called an adverb because it modifies the effect of a
function (a verb). If you'd like to include a function created an adverb
in a package, be sure to read \link{faq-adverbs-export}.

\examples{
f <- function() {
  print("Hi!")
  message("Hello")
  warning("How are ya?")
  "Gidday"
}
f()

f_quiet <- quietly(f)
str(f_quiet())
}
