#' Match/validate a set of conditions for an object and continue with the action
#' associated with the first valid match.

#'
#' `when` is a flavour of pattern matching (or an if-else abstraction) in
#' which a value is matched against a sequence of condition-action sets. When a
#' valid match/condition is found the action is executed and the result of the
#' action is returned.
#'
#' @param .   the value to match against
#' @param ... formulas; each containing a condition as LHS and an action as RHS.
#'   named arguments will define additional values.
#' @return The value resulting from the action of the first valid
#'   match/condition is returned. If no matches are found, and no default is
#'   given, NULL will be returned.
#'
# @details condition-action sets are written as formulas with conditions as
#   left-hand sides and actions as right-hand sides. A formula with only a
#   right-hand will be treated as a condition which is always satisfied. For
#   such a default case one can also omit the `~` symbol, but note that its
#   value will then be evaluated. Any named argument will be made available in
#   all conditions and actions, which is useful in avoiding repeated temporary
#   computations or temporary assignments.
#
#' Validity of the conditions are tested with `isTRUE`, or equivalently
#' with `identical(condition, TRUE)`.
#' In other words conditions resulting in more than one logical will never
#' be valid. Note that the input value is always treated as a single object,
#' as opposed to the `ifelse` function.
