#' Transpose a list.
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#'
#' This function was deprecated in purrr 1.0.0 because [list_transpose()]
#' has a better name and can automatically simplify the output, as is commonly
#' needed.
#'
#' `transpose()` turns a list-of-lists "inside-out"; it turns a pair of lists
#' into a list of pairs, or a list of pairs into pair of lists. For example,
#' if you had a list of length n where each component had values `a` and
#' `b`, `transpose()` would make a list with elements `a` and
#' `b` that contained lists of length n. It's called transpose because
#' \code{x[[1]][[2]]} is equivalent to \code{transpose(x)[[2]][[1]]}.
#'
#' Note that `transpose()` is its own inverse, much like the
#' transpose operation on a matrix. You can get back the original
#' input by transposing it twice.
#'
#' @param .l A list of vectors to transpose. The first element is used as the
#'   template; you'll get a warning if a subsequent element has a different
#'   length.
#' @param .names For efficiency, `transpose()` bases the return structure on
#'   the first component of `.l` by default. Specify `.names` to override this.
#' @return A list with indexing transposed compared to `.l`.
