- title: Map family
  desc: |
    The `map(.x, .f)` functions transforms each element of the vector `.x` with
    the function `.f`, returning a vector defined by the suffix (`_lgl`,
    `_chr()` etc). `walk()` is a variant for functions called primarily for
    their side-effects; it returns `.x` invisibly.

    As well as functions, `.f`, can take numbers and characters (used as a
    shorthand for `[[`), and formulas (used as a succint function definition).
    See details in `as_mapper()`

- title: Map variants
  desc: >
    A rich set of variants builds on the basic idea of `map()`:
    `modify()` modifies "in place", returning a vector the same type as `.x`;
    `map2()` iterates over two vectors in parallel;
    `pmap()` (parallel map) iterates over a list of vectors;
    `imap()` (index map) is a shortcut for the common pattern `map2(x, names(x))`.

- title: Predicate functionals
  desc: >
    A predicate function is a function that either returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    The predicate functionals take a vector and a predicate function and do
    something useful.

- title: Superseded
  description: |
     Superseded functions have been replaced by superior solutions, but
     due to their widespread use will not go away. However, they will not
     get any new features and will only receive critical bug fixes.

- title: Adverbs
  desc: >
    Adverbs modify the action of a function; they take a function as input and
    return a function with modified action as output.
