- title: Map family
  desc: |
    The `map(.x, .f)` functions transforms each element of the vector `.x` with
    the function `.f`, returning a vector defined by the suffix (`_lgl`,
    `_chr()` etc). `walk()` is a variant for functions called primarily for
    their side-effects; it returns `.x` invisibly.

    As well as functions, `.f`, can take numbers and characters (used as a
    shorthand for `[[`), and formulas (used as a succint function definition).
    See details in `as_mapper()`

- title: Map variants
  desc: >
    A rich set of variants builds on the basic idea of `map()`:
    `modify()` modifies "in place", returning a vector the same type as `.x`;
    `map2()` iterates over two vectors in parallel;
    `pmap()` (parallel map) iterates over a list of vectors;
    `imap()` (index map) is a shortcut for the common pattern `map2(x, names(x))`.

- title: Predicate functionals
  desc: >
    A predicate function is a function that either returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    The predicate functionals take a vector and a predicate function and do
    something useful.
